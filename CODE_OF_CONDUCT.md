# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

Homer is a project where everyone should feel welcome, safe, and respected regardless of who they are. We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone — regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or level of experience.

This project is maintained by a queer developer. LGBTQ+ people, people of color, disabled people, and other marginalized folks are explicitly welcome and valued here.

## Standards

**Behavior we expect:**

- Treating each other with kindness, empathy, and good faith
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and receiving constructive feedback gracefully
- Taking responsibility for mistakes and learning from them
- Prioritizing what's best for the community

**Behavior we will not tolerate:**

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind
- Racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist language or actions
- Sexual harassment or unwelcome sexual attention
- Deliberate misgendering or use of deadnames
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Sustained disruption of discussions
- Any conduct that makes people feel unsafe or unwelcome

To be direct: bigots are not welcome here. If you believe some people deserve less respect based on their identity, this is not the project for you.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all project spaces — GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other forums associated with Homer. It also applies when representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior can be reported by opening an issue or contacting the maintainer directly. All reports will be reviewed and responded to promptly.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions and to ban temporarily or permanently anyone whose behavior is harmful, threatening, or otherwise in violation of this Code of Conduct.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is informed by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and the lived experience of its maintainers. It is written to be direct about what we will and will not accept, rather than using soft language that leaves room for bad actors to rules-lawyer their way around the spirit of the document.
