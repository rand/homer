# Code of Conduct

Good software comes from people who feel safe enough to do their best work. This document describes the kind of community we're building and the boundaries we hold.

## The Short Version

Be good to each other. That's the whole thing, really.

If you're someone who treats people with kindness and respect — regardless of who they are, what they look like, who they love, or how they got here — you belong in this community. If that's not you, this isn't the right project.

## What We Mean

Being good to each other looks like:

- Assuming good faith, especially across language and cultural barriers
- Making space for people to ask questions without judgment
- Acknowledging when you're wrong and learning from it
- Recognizing that different people bring different strengths
- Giving feedback on the work, not the person

What we won't accept:

- Harassment or discrimination based on identity — gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, disability, religion, age, or anything else
- Deliberate misgendering, deadnaming, or other identity-based hostility
- Sexual harassment or unwelcome advances
- Doxxing, threats, or intimidation
- Pattern behavior designed to exhaust, exclude, or silence others

This list isn't exhaustive. You know the difference between treating someone well and treating them badly. Act accordingly.

## Scope

This applies everywhere the project lives — issues, PRs, discussions, and any space where you're representing Homer or interacting with its community.

## Enforcement

If someone's behavior is making the community worse, report it by contacting the maintainer directly. Reports will be handled promptly and with discretion.

Consequences range from a conversation to a permanent ban, depending on severity and pattern. The goal is always to protect the people doing good work here.

## Background

This Code of Conduct is informed by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) and by the experience of building software as a queer person in an industry that doesn't always make that easy. The language here is intentionally direct — clarity protects people better than politeness.
